# 🇳🇵 Fake Government Website with Mini Game 🎮

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer:** This is a completely **fake** and **non-functional** government website I made purely for fun and educational purposes when I was in **Class 9**. It does **not** represent any real government service.

## 📚 About This Project

This website was my attempt back in Class 9 to create something that looked *professional* – or at least what I thought professional meant back then 😅. I was just starting to explore HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript, and somehow I ended up making a fake government portal... with a working **mini-game** inside it! 🎯

I know it’s not right to make a fake site like this – but I was young, curious, and just learning how things worked. Now it stands as a **memory** of how far I’ve come in my coding journey. 💻✨

## 🕰️ Why I’m Not Updating It

This project is a **memory** – a snapshot of my beginner days. I'm keeping it **as-is**, without any updates, to remind myself of where I started.  
It might not be perfect… but it’s **mine**. 💖

Thanks for checking this out! If you're a beginner too, remember:  
**Every expert was once a beginner.** Don’t be afraid to build weird stuff. You’ll learn a lot – I sure did. 😄
